#### Introduction

This project provides first-hand experience on the remote DNS cache poisoning attack, or Kaminsky DNS attack. In the project, we're allowed to simultaneously run three virtual machines on a network. The three virtual machines play a role of dns-server, user, and attacker respectively. We implement Kamingsky DNS attack as follow

For my machine, dns-server is 198.165.15.18, user is 198.165.15.19, and attacker is 198.165.15.20.

 
#### Task1: Remote Cache Poisonin
