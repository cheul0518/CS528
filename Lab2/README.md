## Lab2: Remote DNS Cache Poisoning Attack Lab (Due: Feb 28th)

### Introduction

This project provides first-hand experience on the remote DNS cache poisoning attack, or Kaminsky DNS attack. In the project, we're allowed to simultaneously run three virtual machines on a network. The three virtual machines play a role of DNS server, user, and attacker respectively. Kamingsky DNS attack is implemented as follows:

For my machine, DNS server is 198.165.15.18, user is 198.165.15.19, and attacker is 198.165.15.20.
